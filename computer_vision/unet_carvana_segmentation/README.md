# U-Net implementation on Carvana Segmentation Challenge

## Project Overview

This project contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture for image segmentation, specifically applied to the Carvana Image Masking Challenge. The goal of the challenge is to accurately segment car images to identify the car's boundaries.

## U-Net Architecture

The U-Net model is a type of convolutional neural network designed for fast and precise segmentation of images, making it well-suited for this task. The U-Net architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. This design allows the network to learn from a relatively small amount of annotated data while achieving high accuracy in segmentation tasks.

## Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)

In addition to the U-Net implementation, this project leverages Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) to accelerate training and reduce memory usage. AMP dynamically adjusts the precision of the computations, allowing for faster training times without sacrificing model accuracy.

## Experiment Tracking with Weights and Biases (wandb)

We also integrate Weights and Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking and visualization. Wandb provides tools to log metrics, visualize model performance, and collaborate with team members, making it easier to manage and optimize the training process.

## Conclusion

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for image segmentation using state-of-the-art techniques and tools to enhance performance and productivity.

# Simple CNN for Computer Vision

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for computer vision tasks. The contents include:

- `cnn_example.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that provides a step-by-step guide to building, training, and evaluating a CNN model on a sample dataset. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and performance evaluation.

This project serves as an educational resource for understanding the basics of CNNs and how to implement them using popular deep learning frameworks.
